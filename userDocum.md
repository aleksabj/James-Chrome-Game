Monster Dash is an infinite runner game where your goal is to help James, the main character, avoid various Pixar-themed obstacles and collect socks for extra points. The longer you survive, the higher your score will climb.

5) If you hit an obstacle, the game will end, and you will see your final score along with the number of socks collected.
6) Press any key to restart from the menu.
